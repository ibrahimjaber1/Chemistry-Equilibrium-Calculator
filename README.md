# Chemistry-Equilibrium-Calculator
A python project that I used to help me complete my chemistry homework efficiently.

Program will take in user given values and will then calculate a simplified and more accurate equilibrium ratio. 
Each calculation iteration is indexed so the user is able to see at what iteration the equilibrium forms.
